# customBottomFragmentview
I have seen lot of issue in reloading bottom fragment view when clicking on fragment so i came up with a solution,Hope it helps!!
just u need to create 4 or 5 fragments and give tagnames for all and justify tags with your fragments
follow the code and enjoy!!
for better working with bottomnavigation view give swipe refresh layout for all your fragments
